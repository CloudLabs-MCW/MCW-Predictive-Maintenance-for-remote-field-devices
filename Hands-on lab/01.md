## Exercise 1: Configuring IoT Central with devices and metadata

Duration: 45 minutes

[Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-central/) is a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering from Microsoft. The aim of this service is to provide a frictionless entry into the Cloud Computing and IoT space. The core focus of many industrial companies is not on cloud computing; therefore, they do not necessarily have the personnel skilled to provide guidance and to stand up a reliable and scalable infrastructure for an IoT solution. It is imperative for these types of companies to enter the IoT space not only for the cost savings associated with remote monitoring, but also to improve safety for their workers and the environment.

Fabrikam is one such company that could use a helping hand entering the IoT space. They have recently invested in sensor technology on their rod pumps in the field, and they are ready to implement their cloud-based IoT Solution. Their IT department is small and unfamiliar with cloud-based IoT infrastructure; their IT budget also does not afford them the luxury of hiring a team of contractors to build out a solution for them.

The Fabrikam CIO has recently heard of Azure IoT Central. This online offering will streamline the process of them getting their sensor data to the cloud, where they can monitor their equipment for failures and improve their maintenance practices and not have to worry about the underlying infrastructure. A [predictable cost model](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/iot-central/) also ensures that there are no financial surprises.

### Task 1: Model the telemetry data

The first task is to identify the data that the equipment will be sending to the cloud. This data will contain fields that represent the data read from the sensors at a specific instant in time. This data will be used in downstream systems to identify patterns that can lead to cost savings, increased safety and more efficient work processes.

The telemetry being reported by the Fabrikam rod pumps are as follows, we will be using this information later in the lab:

#### Telemetry schema

    ![The IoT Central Application form is shown populated with the preceding values.](media/azure-iot-central-new-application.png "IoT Central Application form")

4. Wait for the application to be provisioned.

### Task 3: Create the Device Template

1. In the Azure Portal, open the `Fabrikam_Oil` resource group. Select the IoT Central Application resource from the listing.

   ![The Fabrikam_Oil resource group listing is shown with the IoT Central Application highlighted.](media/iot-central-application-resource-list.png "Fabrikam_Oil resource listing")

2. From the IoT Central Application Overview screen, select the _IoT Central Application URL_. This opens the IoT Central application in a new tab in your browser.

    ![The IoT Central Application Overview screen is shown with the IoT Central Application URL highlighted.](media/iot-central-application-overview.png "IoT Central Overview screen")

3. We need to define the type of equipment we are using, and the data associated with the equipment. In order to do this, we must define a _Device Template_. Select the _Device Templates_ menu item from the left-hand menu. Then select _+ New_ from the toolbar menu.

    ![The Device templates button is selected from the left menu and the + New button is highlighted from the toolbar.](media/create-device-templates.png "Device Templates")

4. On the `Select type` screen, select _IoT device_ as the custom device template type. Select the _Next: Customize_ button.

    ![The IoT device card is selected on the Select type screen.](media/new-template-custom.png "Custom Template Type")

5. On the `Customize` form, for the device template name, enter _Rod Pump_. Keep the `Gateway device` checkbox unchecked. Select the _Next: Review_ button.

    ![The Customize form is displayed populated as described.](media/rod-pump-template-create.png "Customize form")

6. On the `Review` screen, select the _Create_ button.

7. On the `Rod Pump` device template screen, select _Custom model_ beneath the `Create a model` heading.

    ![The Rod Pump device template screen is displayed with the Custom model item selected.](media/create-a-custom-model.png "Device template screen")

8. On the Rod Pump `Model` screen, select the `Model` parent item in the central navigation pane. Select _Add capability to default component_ from beneath the `Capabilities` heading.

    ![The Model screen is displayed with the Add capability to default component card selected.](media/add-capability-to-default-model.png "Device Template Model Screen")

9. The `Capabilities` of the device model describe the _telemetry_ expected from the device, the _commands_ it responds to, and its _properties_ ([device twin properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/howto-use-properties)). We'll begin defining the `Telemetry` values, populate the capabilities as described in the following table. Use the _+ Add capability_ button at the bottom of the screen to add additional telemetry values. Select the _Save_ button from the toolbar once complete. You will need to expand the capability form to edit the Schema, Unit, Display Unit and Description fields.

    | Display Name   | Name     | Capability Type | Semantic Type | Schema | Unit   |  Display Unit | Description |
    |----------------|----------|-----------------| --------------|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
    | Pump Rate       | PumpRate       | Telemetry | None | Double | None |  SPM     | Speed calculated over the time duration between the last two times the crank arm has passed the proximity sensor measured in Strokes Per Minute (SPM)  |
    | Time Pump On    | TimePumpOn     | Telemetry | Time Span | Double | Minute |  Minutes | Number of minutes the pump has been on |
    | Motor Power     | MotorPowerKw   | Telemetry | Power | Double | None |  kW      | Measured in Kilowatts (kW) |
    | Motor Speed     | MotorSpeed     | Telemetry | Angular Velocity | Integer | Revolution per minute |  RPM     | including slip (RPM) |
    | Casing Friction | CasingFriction | Telemetry | None | Double | None |  PSI     | strokes per minute |

    ![The Rod Pump model Capabilities form is shown populated with the aforementioned Telemetry values.](media/model-telemetry.png "Telemetry Capabilities")

10. We also need to define the current state of the pump, whether it is running or not. Remaining on the same screen, Select _+ Add capability_. Add the state with the display name of _Power State_, field name of _PowerState_, capability type of _Telemetry_ and semantic type of _State_. For Value schema, select _String_ then add the values _Unavailable_, _On_, and _Off_ (in each the Display name, Name and Value columns). Select the _Save_ button from the toolbar menu.

    ![The screen displays the state configuration options.](media/power-state-definition.png "Power State")

11. In the device template, Properties are metadata associated with the equipment. For our template, we will expect a property for Serial Number, IP Address, and the geographic location of the pump. Remaining on the same screen, select _+ Add capability_. Define the device properties as follows, then select _Save_ from the toolbar menu:

    | Display Name  | Name         | Capability Type | Semantic Type | Schema | Writable | Description                       |
    | ------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ------ |--------- | --------------------------------- |
    | Serial Number | SerialNumber | Property  | None | String      | Off |The Serial Number of the rod pump |
    | IP Address    | IPAddress    | Property  | None | String      | Off |The IP address of the rod pump    |
    | Pump Location | Location     | Property  |  Location | Geopoint  | Off | The geo. location of the rod pump |

    ![The screen displays the device properties.](media/device-properties-form.png "Device Properties Form")

12. Operators and field workers will want to be able to turn on and off the pumps remotely. In order to do this, we will define a command. Remaining on the same screen, select _+ Add capability_. Select the _Commands_ tab and select the _New_ button to add a new command. Create a command as follows, and select _Save_ from the toolbar:

    - _Display Name_ - _Toggle Motor Power_
    - _Name_ - _ToggleMotorPower_
    - _Capability Type_ - _Command_
    - _Request_ - _On_
    - (Request) _Display name_ - _Toggle_
    - (Request) _Name_ - _Toggle_
    - (Request) _Schema_ - _Boolean_
    - _Description_ - _Toggle the motor power of the pump on and off_.

    ![The command form fields are displayed and populated as described.](media/device-template-add-command.png "Create command capability")
  
13. The `Rod Pump` capabilities should now look similar to the following (collapsed):

    ![A summary (collapsed) view of the Rod Pump model capabilities is displayed.](media/device-capabilities-summary.png "Rod Pump Capabilities list")

14. Now, we can define device specific views to help us visualize telemetry and state of the Rod Pumps. We can also create forms to allow pump operators to execute commands on a device. From the center pane navigation menu of the Rod Pump device template, select the _Views_ item. In the `Select to add a new view` screen, select the _Visualizing the device_ card.

    ![The Device templates Views screen is shown with the Visualizing the device card highlighted.](media/device-template-add-new-view.png "Device template views")

15. A View is composed of one or more tiles that display information related to a specific device. In the Edit view form, set the _View name_ to _Dashboard_. Then expand the _Telemetry_ drop down and select each item individually, then choosing the _Add tile_ button to add the chart to the View surface. Feel free to arrange the tiles as desired on the View design surface.

    ![The device template Dashboard edit screen is shown, with an item selected in the Telemetry section, and the Add tile button highlighted.](media/view-adding-telemetry-tiles-view.png "Composing a device view")

16. Remaining on the Dashboard view, expand the `Property` drop down list, and add a tile for `IP Address`, `Serial Number`, and `Pump Location`. Note that the tile for `Pump Location` renders with a map icon, meaning that IoT Central has identified the property as geography-based data, and will render it on a map appropriately.

    ![A portion of the Dashboard View design surface is shown with tiles added for various properties of the device.](media/view-adding-properties-tiles.png "Device property tiles")

17. Spend some time now and investigate the various visualizations and settings you can set on each tile. For instance, you have the ability to customize chart types, colors and axes. You can also resize each tile individually. Select the _Save_ button in the toolbar menu to save the `Dashboard` view.

18. On the `Rod Pump` device template screen, select the `Views` item from the central navigation pane, and choose `Visualizing the device` once again to create a new view. Name this view, `Command` and add a tile for the `Toggle Motor Power` command. Once complete, press the `Save` button in the toolbar. This View will allow pump operators to initiate the toggle power command from the IoT Central application.

19. Finally, we can add a thumbnail image to represent the equipment. Select on the circle icon to left of the template name. This will allow you to select an image file. The image used in this lab can be found on [PixaBay](https://pixabay.com/photos/refinery-pump-oil-pump-industry-514010/). After setting the thumbnail, select the `Publish` button in the device template toolbar.

    ![The header portion of the Rod Pump device template is shown with the thumbnail and Publish menu item highlighted.](media/device-template-thumbnail.png "Device Template Thumbnail and Publishing")

### Task 4: Create and provision real devices

Under the hood, Azure IoT Central uses the [Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service (DPS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/about-iot-dps). The aim of DPS is to provide a consistent way to connect devices to the Azure Cloud. Devices can utilize Shared Access Signatures, or X.509 certificates to securely connect to IoT Central.

[Multiple options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/concepts-get-connected) exist to register devices in IoT Central, ranging from individual device registration to [bulk device registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-central/core/howto-manage-devices#import-devices) via a comma delimited file. In this lab we will register a single device using SAS.

1. In the left-hand menu of your IoT Central application, select _Devices_. Select the _Rod Pump_ template from the `Devices` blade and select the _+ New_ button from the toolbar to add a new device.

    ![The Devices menu item is selected, with Rod Pump selected from the Devices blade. The + New button is highlighted in the toolbar.](media/add-real-device-menu.png "Add a device menu")

2. A modal window will be displayed with an automatically generated Device ID and Device Name. You are able to overwrite these values with anything that makes sense in your downstream systems. We will be creating three real devices in this lab. Create the following as real devices, ensure `Simulate this device` remains toggled off:

    ![The create new device modal is displayed populated with the details of DEVICE001.](media/real-device-id.png "Create a new device modal")

    | Device Name          | Device ID |
    | -------------------- | --------- |
    | Rod Pump - DEVICE001 | DEVICE001 |
    | Rod Pump - DEVICE002 | DEVICE002 |
    | Rod Pump - DEVICE003 | DEVICE003 |

3. On the Devices list, notice how all three real devices have the provisioning status of _Registered_.

    ![All of the devices are listed and their associated provisioning status. The devices show as registered.](media/new-devices-registered.png "Device Listing")
